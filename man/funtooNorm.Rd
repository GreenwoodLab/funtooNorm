\title{This function applies the normalization method central to the package to each
signal.
The chrY have a deserve a specific treatment, men are asses using the median
beta estimation on the raw data positions with a cutoff at 60%. We perform
on the mens a quantile normalization and we do not change the women values}
\usage{
funtooNorm(object, type.fits = "PCR", ncmp = 4, force = FALSE,
  sex = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{of type SampleSet}

\item{type.fits}{can be "PCR" or "PLS" (default "PCR")}

\item{ncmp}{number of components used in the analysis (default 4)}

\item{force}{set it to TRUE in order to re-compute the normalisation whent 
it is already done}

\item{sex}{boolean vector: when not null force the chrY normalization to use 
treat the TRUE values as mens}
}
\value{
a SampleSet containing the normalised signal
}
